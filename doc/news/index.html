      <h3>TASCAR 0.228.1 released</h3>
      <p>Bugfix of loudspeaker calibration wizard: When
        frequency-dependent speaker correction was active, the
        broadband calibration is now measured with active speaker
        correction.</p> <br/>

      <time>November 28, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.228 released</h3>
      <p>Allow to use material names instead of filter coefficients in
      reflectors. Some materials definitions are built into TASCAR,
      more can be defined within a scene. Furthermore, the speaker
      calibration uses now the more robust Nelder-Mead method for
      optimization of parameteric equalizers.</p> <br/>

      <time>September 29, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.227.1 released</h3>
      <p>This is a minor bugfix release to fix the behavior of the
      sndfile plugin: The timeline-independent playback of sound files
      did not work correctly when the file load was triggered via
      OSC. This, and the documentation of the sndfile plugin, is
      updated with this release.</p> <br/>

      <time>September 25, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.227 released</h3>
      <p>The dataloggin supports a headless mode for command line
      applications, improved handling of LSL streams and some other
      improvements (e.g., support of datalogging on macOS). The GUI
      was partly re-designed, and works again on macOS and
      Windows. Head tracking with the <em>ovheadtracker</em> module
      was improved further.</p> <br/>

      <time>May 28, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.226 released</h3>
      <p>The crossover filters in subwoofer bass management are now
      using correct Butterworth filter design with 24 dB/Octave slopes
      and corect phase. Furthermore, the calibration method was
      improved to avoid compensation of the crossover filters by the
      calibration process. Also the MPU6050 based head tracking was
      improved to achieve a resolution near 1/100 of a degree
      (compared to approx. 1 degree in the previous version).</p>
      <br/>

      <time>May 23, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.225.1 released</h3>
      <p>The loudspeaker calibration wizard was completely redesignd,
      and spectral correction of loudspeakers based on parametric
      filter banks was added (optional). Also the data logging was
      improved and many other minor bugs fixed as well as features
      added.</p>  <br/>

      <time>March 9, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.224 released</h3>
      <p>With this release, some new features were added and some bugs were fixed: The spawning of subprocesses was redesigned for more control, e.g., re-spawning after process ended. The data logging was bugfixed; in some conditions the logging of LSL streams ended after several minutes. A method to discover OSC variables and their current values was added, which enables the development of GUIs. The offline rendering tools now support specification of channel maps (thanks to A. Moore), and the build on macOS was significantly improved.</p>  <br/>

      <time>January 11, 2022</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.223 released</h3>
      <p>Bugfix of diffuse sound field decoding: an invalid scaling of
      the decoding order gain resulted in lower spatial
      resolution. With this bugfix, the diffuse field processing of
      the directional mask plugin <em>multibeam</em> was implemented
      and tested.</p>  <br/>

      <time>November 12, 2021</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.222 released</h3>
      <p>Optional convolution of loudspeaker channels with HRIR for all speaker-based receivers.</p>  <br/>

      <time>November 10, 2021</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.221 released</h3>
      <p>Fix orientation and channel order of diffuse sound fields, minor bugfixes and documentation.</p>  <br/>

      <time>September 29, 2021</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.220 released</h3>
      <p>Fix dependency problem with LSL, minor improvements of various plugins, documentation and scripts.</p>  <br/>

      <time>June 28, 2020</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.213 released</h3>
      <p>A parametric HRTF simulation binaural receiver type was
	added. The parametrization is based on the Spherical Head
	Model (SHM) by Brown and Duda (1998) and includes three
	further low-order filters as originally suggested by Oliver
	Buttler and Stephan D. Ewert and implemented in the room
	acoustics simulator RAZR (Wendt et al.,
	2014; <a href="http://www.razrengine.com">www.razrengine.com</a>).
	This receiver implementation is an outcome of the bachelor
	thesis of Fenja Schwark.</p> <br/>

      <time>February 25, 2020</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.212 released</h3>
      <p>Source directivity defaults now to omni-directional for
      volumetric (diffuse) receiver types. This can be overwritten for
      new source directivity types, e.g, to account for average
      diffuse radiation frequency response.</p> <br/>

      <time>February 10, 2020</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.211 released</h3>
      <p>A partitioned convolution for for rendering diffuse
      reverberation based on recorded B-format impulse responses was
      added, and the simple feedback delay network (FDN) was
      improved.</p> <br/>

      <time>January 31, 2020</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.210 released</h3>
      <p>A receiver type for rendering to ITU 5.1 speaker layouts was
      added. Furthermore, a new diffuse reverberation concept was
      developed, to allow diffuse reverb also in offline simulation
      and without recursive signal routing. A simple feedback delay
      network (FDN) was added as a prototype algorithm.</p>  <br/>

      <time>January 17, 2020</time>
      <h3>TASCAR 0.209 released</h3>
      <p>Addition of A weighting to level metering, some GUI improvements and bug fixes. Switching of meter weighting at run-time is now possible.</p>  <br/>
