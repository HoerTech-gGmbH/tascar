# Debian package management by Jenkins:
# New Debian Packages are stored in our storage for debian repositories.
# The storage is cleaned of old packages depending on the current branch.
#
# Glossary:
#
# supply:
# The packages stored here have just been built. Location is
# project-specific. For tascarpro, it is ./distributions/tascar/$SYSTEM/
# regardless of $BRANCH_NAME.
# The packages here may be new or they may be rebuilds of
# existing versions (e.g. if someone clicks build-now while
# there is no new revision). Rebuilds of existing versions
# will not be used, but will cause an update of the timestamp of the respective
# files in storage.  New packages are copied to storage
#
# storage:
# The packages here are kept persistently across builds.
# Old packets (timestamp older than some threshold) will be deleted for
# branch development.
# Storage location:
# /var/lib/jenkins/packages-for-aptly/STORAGE/$PROJECT/$BRANCH_NAME/$SYSTEM/
# on the host, which is mounted to /STORAGE/$PROJECT/$BRANCH_NAME/$SYSTEM/
# in the container.
#
# $PROJECT:
# openMHA, liblsl, liblsl-matlab, tascarpro, more may be added
#
# $BRANCH_NAME:
# master, uploaded to apt.hoertech.de, and development, uploaded to
# aptdev.hoertech.de. BRANCH_NAME is set by Jenkins
#
# SYSTEMs:
# trusty, xenial, bionic, stretch, jessie, etc. Available SYSTEMs that
# contain packages are detected automatically.

# There will by $SYSTEM subdirectories below this directory.
# These subdirectories then contain the package files.
