Send band levels via OSC.

\input{tabbandlevel2osc.tex}

If $N$ is the number of channels and $B$ the number of frequency
bands, the OSC message will contain $N*B+1$ floating point values. The
first value contains the object time in seconds, the other floats
contain the RMS level within the current audio block in dB SPL.
