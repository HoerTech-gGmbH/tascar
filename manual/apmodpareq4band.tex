The Parametric Equalizer is a software plugin designed to provide precise control over the frequency response of audio signals. It features a 4-band parametric equalizer per channel, allowing for detailed shaping of the frequency spectrum. The plugin supports any number of channels, with all channels processed with the same filter parameters.

Each channel features a 4-band equalizer, consisting of a low-shelf filter (22-560 Hz), a mid1-eq filter (150 Hz - 1.5 kHz), a mid2-eq filter (560 Hz - 5.6 kHz), and a high-shelf filter (1.5 kHz - 24 kHz). Each band has a gain range of -20 to +20 dB, allowing for precise control over the frequency response.
