This plugin can analyse input levels and send percentile peak levels and A-weighted RMS levels as an internal OSC message. The audio signal is divided into segments of tau_segment duration. The peak level and the A-weighted RMS level are calculated in each segment. All short-term levels within tau_analysis are collected and on each analysis call the levels are sorted to derive percentile levels.
