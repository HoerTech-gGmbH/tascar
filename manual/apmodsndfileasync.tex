Add a sound file and play back at a given time, with asynchronous file access.
%
This plugin provides an alternative to the sndfile audio plugin
(see \ref{sec:ap_sndfile}). It does not require to load the full
file during session load, which can be advantageous for huge files. As
a drawback, it is not possible to configure absolute RMS value, and
dropouts may occur if the file system is slower than required.
%
If the plugin receives multiple channels (e.g., when used in a
receiver or a diffuse sound field), all channels starting at channel
number \attr{channel} will be returned. If the file does not contain a
sufficient number of channels, silence will be returned for all
channels not available in the sound file.
