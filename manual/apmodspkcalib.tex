This plugin allows to use a loudspeaker definition file for
calibration processing. Typical application is in a standalone route
or as post processing of virtual stereo microphones. Please note that
diffuse sound field properties are not applicable. Also port
connections defined in the loudspeaker layout are not applied.

The number of channels must match the total number of output channels
(main speaker, subwoofer, and convolution channels).
