Apply a raised cosine-ramp after changes of the transport state. The
duration of the ramp can be controlled separately for transitions from
stopped to rolling (\attr{startduration}) and from rolling to stopped
(\attr{endduration}).

If the ramps are not pre-calculated (\attr{precalc="false"}), the
duration can be changed via OSC.
