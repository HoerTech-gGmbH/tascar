This command line tool is used to render the impulse response of a \tascar{} scene. A typical usage example might be

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
  tascar_renderir -o output_file.wav -f 44100 -1 2 tascar_scene.tsc
\end{lstlisting}

Here the impulse response is saved in \verb!output_file.wav! with a sampling rate of 44100 Hz and up to 2nd order image source model.
