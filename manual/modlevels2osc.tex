\begin{tscattributes}
\indattr{pattern}      & Source port names                                     \\
\indattr{noisepattern} & Source port names for noise signals, to calculate SNR \\
\indattr{url}          & Target OSC URL                                        \\
\indattr{ttl}          & Time to live of OSC multicast messages                \\
\end{tscattributes}

This module reads the level meters of the specified ports and sends
their values as OSC data and LSL streams.
%
If \attr{pattern} and \attr{noisepattern} match the same number of
ports and each port has the same number of audio channels, then the
SNR is calculated and transmitted instead of levels.
%
A potential application is data logging of levels or SNRs.
