OSC based EOG sensor driver


This module receives data from an open hardware electro-oculography (EOG) sensor. It connects to the sensor and configures the sampling rate. Based on the data, it supports three stages: in the first stage, the data can be recorded using the data logging module. The second stage provides a post-filter (see variables starting with ``pf\_'') consisting of a low-pass filter and a maximum and minimum tracker to detect eye blinks independently of drift. The third stage is the animation of the blinks, which can be either ``none'', ``transmitted'' or ``randomised''.
