OSC based EOG sensor driver


This module receives data from an open hardware electro-oculography (EOG) sensor. It connects to the sensor and configures the sampling rate. Based on the data, it supports three stages: in the first stage, the data can be recorded using the data logging module. The second stage provides a post-filter (see variables starting with ``pf\_'') consisting of a low-pass filter and a maximum and minimum tracker to detect eye blinks independently of drift. The third stage is the animation of the blinks, which can be either ``none'', ``transmitted'' or ``randomised''.

In animation mode the duration of each blink $\tau_{d}$ is drawn from a log-normal distribution defined by the variables \attr{pf\_anim\_blink\_duration\_mu} and \attr{pf\_anim\_blink\_duration\_sigma}. The duration is limited to the interval $[0,20\,\textrm{s}]$ seconds The time between two blinks is taken from a normal distribution of blink frequency (\attr{pf\_anim\_blink\_freq\_mu} and \attr{pf\_anim\_blink\_freq\_sigma}) and transformed into a duration. The period time is limited to the interval $[\tau_{d},30\,\textrm{s}]$ to avoid excessively long blink gaps. The rectangular eye blink data is filtered with an attack-release filter with the time constants \attr{pf\_anim\_random\_tau\_attack} and \attr{pf\_anim\_random\_tau\_release}.
