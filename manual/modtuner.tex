This instrument tuner plug-in is designed for real-time audio analysis and tuning assistance. It processes audio input to detect pitch and provides detailed tuning information via Open Sound Control (OSC) messages. Supporting various tuning systems, including equal temperament, Werckmeister and Meantone, the plugin is highly versatile and can be used for a wide range of musical applications. It features a strobe display to aid visual tuning and operates efficiently with a separate thread that handles OSC communication, preventing interruptions to audio processing. The plugin is configurable, offering adjustments for the frequency range, the analysis window length and the tuning temperament.
