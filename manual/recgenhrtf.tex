HRTF simulation.

This receiver describes the main features of measured head related transfer
functions by using a few low-order digital filters. The parametrization is
based on the Spherical Head Model (SHM) by \citet{BrownDuda}
and includes three further low-order filters.

The SHM introduces an approach to model the head as a rigid sphere.
It includes a model for the head shadow effect as well as a method to
compute the interaural time difference.
The head shadow effect is approximated by a first-order high-shelf filter
which depth varies depending on the incident angle. The high-shelf can be
described by means of three parameters: The cut-off frequency \indattr{omega},
the angle \indattr{thetamin} at which the maximal depth of the high-shelf is
reached and the parameter \indattr{alphamin} which influences the maximal
reached depth of the high-shelf.

The Duda SHM was extended by O.\ Buttler and S.D.\ Ewert in the context
of room acoustics simulator RAZR \citep{Wendt2014b,Ewert2018}
in \citet{Buttler2018} to improve left-right, front-back, and
elevation perception:

i) a pre-warping of the azimuth angles is introduced to better match experimentally
observed interaural level differences as a function of azimuth, particularly in
the frontal region.

ii) Two further first-order high-shelf filters similarly to that which
realizes the SHM are used to model pinna
- respectively torso - shadow. These filters are as well described by
three parameters. The two parameters \indattr{alphamin\_front} and
\indattr{omega\_front} -- respectively \indattr{alphamin\_up} and
\indattr{omega\_up} -- are used in the same way as described for the SHM.
However, the third parameter \indattr{startangle\_front} -- respectively
\indattr{startangle\_up} --, which is defined with respect to a certain
reference direction (front [1 0 0] -- respectively up [0 0 1]), is used
in order to define a region of incident directions in which these filters
are applied. The maximal depth is reached at 180 degrees with respect to
the reference direction.

iii) Furthermore, a notch filter is used in order to reproduce the concha notch
which provides an important feature in order to distinguish between elevation
angles. This filter is applied in the upper hemisphere for angles smaller
than \indattr{startangle\_notch}. In order to have a smooth transition, the
gain of the notch increases linearly from 0 dB at \indattr{startangle\_notch}
to the \indattr{maxgain} for an incidence direction directly above the head.
Moreover, the center frequency is chosen to vary linearly over the range
as well. At \indattr{startangle\_notch} the center frequency is equal to
\indattr{freq\_start} as changes linearly to \indattr{freq\_end} for incidence
direction right above the head. Furthermore, the notch is described by the
quality factor \indattr{Q\_notch}.

In order to optimize the values for the filter parameters of the
original RAZR SHM-Model, the frequency response of the receiver has
been fitted to measured HRTFs of the KEMAR dummy
head \citep{Schwark2020} provided by the OlHeaD-HRTF
database~\citep{Denk2020}.
