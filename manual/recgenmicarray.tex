Microphone array simulation.

This receiver implements a hierarchic parametric multi-microphone (head-)model.
The (relative) transfer functions are parameterized by a filter and a delay model.
For each node of the hierarchic structure a delay model needs to be chosen (default
freefield). A filter model can be defined by setting a single or multiple filter
models. Multiple filter models are applied in a cascade. If no filter model is set,
the transfer functions corresponds to a pure delay component.

Two filter types are implemented:

i) A High-Shelf Filter (\indattr{highshelf})

The spatial design of this filter is an adopted version of the Spherical Head Model by
\citet{BrownDuda}. As proposed by Brown and Duda, a first order high-shelf is created
by the single pole-zero pair $s_p=-2\omega$ and $s_z=\frac{-2\omega}{\alpha(\theta)}$. 
However, the design function $\alpha(\theta)$ is adopted and additional parameters are
added to allow for a higher variability of the filter design.
Adaptation of the design function results in the following:
\begin{align}
\alpha(\theta)= \left(\cfrac{{\color{black!30!blue}\alpha_{st}}}{2} +
\cfrac{{\color{black!20!red}\alpha_m}}{2}\right) +
\left(\cfrac{{\color{black!30!blue}\alpha_{st}}}{2} -
\cfrac{{\color{black!20!red}\alpha_m}}{2}\right)\cdot\cos\left(\cfrac{\theta -
{\color{red!40!yellow}\theta_{st}}}{{\color{black!30!green}\beta}\cdot(\pi -
{\color{red!40!yellow}\theta_{st}})}\cdot \pi\right) 
\forall \ \theta \leq {\color{red!40!yellow}\theta_{st}}
\end{align}

Table \ref{Tab_alpha} shows how the four parameters \indattr{alpha\_st}, \indattr{alpha\_m},
\indattr{theta\_st} and \indattr{beta} of this filter type can be used to vary the course of
the design function and thus the spatial design of the filter.
Furthermore, the frequency \indattr{omega} is an additional parameter of this filter
type. By varying the frequency \indattr{omega} the position of the pole and the zero are
varied and the range in which the high-shelf is applied is adjusted.
Moreover, the orientation \indattr{axis} of the filter can be chosen freely. The angle
$\theta$ is then computed with respect to the specified orientation \indattr{axis}.

ii) A Parametric Equalizer (\indattr{equalizer})

With the aid of a second-order parametric equalizer a cut or boost can be created around
a certain center frequency. The spatial design of the parametric equalizer is a continuous
variation in center frequency and gain. The design is defined with respect to a freely
selectable orientation \indattr{axis}.
The gain \indattr{gain\_st} is applied in the direction of this orientation \indattr{axis}.
Moreover, the gain of the parametric equalizer is equal to \indattr{gain\_end} at the angle
\indattr{theta\_end}. The gain is continuously varied in between.
The center frequency of the parametric equalizer is continuously varied between the starting
value \indattr{omega\_st} at the orientation \indattr{axis} and the end value
\indattr{omega\_end} at the angle \indattr{theta\_end}.

It can be chosen between two delay models:

i) Free-Field (\indattr{freefield})

This delay model determines the delay between two microphones in the free field.

ii) Sphere (\indattr{sphere})

This delay models the delay of a microphone positioned on a sphere. The used formula is
the model proposed by \citet{BrownDuda} for modeling the interaural time delay for the
Spherical Head Model.

Table \ref{Tab_delaymodels} shows the graphical representation as well as provides the used
formulas for the computation of the delay models. The delay model is always applied with
respect to the parent microphone.
