This receiver implements a simple Feedback Delay Network (FDN) based
on \citet{Schroeder1962} and \citet{Rocchesso1997}. It uses a first
order Ambisonics sound field for each audio sample, and applies a
rotation at each reflection.

To set the room
dimensions, use the \attr{volumetric} attribute. By default, the
$T_{60}$ is calculated using the Sabine's formula, see
\attr{absorption}. If an explicit $T_{60}$ is provided, this is used
and the \attr{absorption} attribute is ignored.

The output signal has ACN channel order and FuMa normalization.
