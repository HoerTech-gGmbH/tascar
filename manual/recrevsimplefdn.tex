This receiver implements a simple Feedback Delay Network (FDN) based
on \citet{Schroeder1962} and \citet{Rocchesso1997}. It uses a first
order Ambisonics sound field for each audio sample, and applies a
rotation at each reflection.

To set the room
dimensions, use the \attr{volumetric} attribute. By default, the
$T_{60}$ is calculated using the Sabine's formula, see
\attr{absorption}. If an explicit $T_{60}$ is provided, this is used
and the \attr{absorption} attribute is ignored.

If the variables \attr{vcf} and \attr{vt60} are specified, an
iterative optimization process will be started. Resulting optimized
parameters will be printed at the console and can be used for further
usage as long as the sampling rate or other parameters of the plugin
are not altered.

The output signal has ACN channel order and FuMa normalization.
