Horizontal higher-order Ambisonics with embedded decoder, for regular
loudspeaker layouts.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
<receiver type="hoa2d" order="3" maxre="true">...</receiver>
\end{lstlisting}

This receiver type provides horizontal higher order ambisonics with
basic or $\max r_E$ decoding.
%
If \attr{order} is zero or unset, then the maximum possible order for
the given number of loudspeakers is used.

\paragraph{Note:}
Only regular speaker arrays can be used. Explicit speaker
distributions are ignored, and a regular speaker distribution with
counter-clockwise azimuths is assumed, with the first speaker starting
at the value provided in the \attr{rotation} attribute.
%
If the \attr{rotation} attribute is not given, then the average
difference between a regular layout and the explicit speaker azimuth
is taken as \attr{rotation}.

If \indattr{diffup} is set to ``true'', diffuse-decoding is using the
internal decoder, which is also used for decoding of panned sources.
%
If \indattr{diffup} is set to ``false'', the standard speaker-based
diffuse render method is applied.
%
Source-width encoding splits the signal into two uncorrelated signals
and creates virtual sound sources separated by the source width.

An alternative receiver type \verb!hoa2d_fuma! can be used to return
the encoded signal in FuMa normalization and ACN channel sequence.
