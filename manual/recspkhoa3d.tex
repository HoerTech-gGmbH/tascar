Higher order Ambisonics receiver (3D) with embedded decoder, for
arbitrary 3D speaker layouts.

\input{tabreceiverhoa3d.tex}

Either the Ambisonics mode matching method using the pseudo-inverse of
the encoding matrix can be used, \attr{method="pinv"}, or the ALLRAD
method via regular virtual speakers rendered with VBAP,
\attr{method="allrad"}. See \citet{Daniel2001} and
\citet{Heller2012,Heller2014} for details; the decoding methods have
been validated against the Ambisonics Decoder Toolbox
\citep{Heller2014}. Except for minor differences in the underlying
triangulation method the results are comparable.


\paragraph{Note:}
No automatic order calculation from based on the loudspeaker layout is
applied, thus it is always required to configure the correct
Ambisonics order.

\paragraph{Note:} With AllRAD decoder, the triangulation of the speaker layout may differ depending on the operating system and version due to different numerical resolutions. This can lead to different speaker channel signals, but the effects on perception should be negligible.
