This module inherits from \hyperref[attrtab:speakerbased]{speaker based receiver} methods and has no specific attributes. Note that 3-dimensional VBAP only works with non-flat layout files, i.e. the convex hull must cover the origin.

\paragraph{Note:} The triangulation of the speaker layout may differ depending on the operating system and version due to different numerical resolutions. This can lead to different speaker channel signals, but the effects on perception should be negligible.
