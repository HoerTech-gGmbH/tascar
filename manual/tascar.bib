  abstract =	 {Implementation of Ambisonic reproduction systems is
                  limited by the number and placement of the
                  loudspeak-ers. In practice, real-world systems tend
                  to have in-sufficient loudspeaker coverage above and
                  below the listening position. Because the
                  localization experi-enced by the listener is a
                  nonlinear function of the loudspeaker signals it is
                  difficult to derive suitable de-coders
                  analytically. As an alternative, it is possible to
                  derive decoders via a search process in which
                  analytic estimators of the localization quality are
                  evaluated at each search position. We discuss the
                  issues involved and describe a set of tools for
                  generating optimized decoder solutions for irregular
                  loudspeaker arrays and demonstrate those tools with
                  practical examples.},

                  Toolbox to efficiently design periphonic decoders
                  for non-uniform speaker arrays such as hemispherical
                  domes and multilevel rings. These techniques include
                  modified inversion, AllRAD, and spherical Slepian
                  function-based decoders. We also describe a new

                  full-featured decoders in the Faust DSP
                  specification language, which can then be compiled
                  into a variety of plug-in formats. Informal
                  listening tests and performance measurements
                  indicate that these decoders work well for speaker
                  arrays that are difficult to handle with
